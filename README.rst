--------
Overview
--------

TrafficChecker is an Android app that parses public available
traffic data and represents it as a text list or on a map with icons.

------------
Instructions
------------

Start the app, choose one or more regions via the
"Select regions..." party. Then wait until the traffic news show up
or an error occurs ;)
You can click a traffic item and it will lead you to the map, to
switch back to the text view hit the back button or check the menu.

Contributions

Sadly I have to admit that my code is poorly documented, but atleast most
of the code is not very complex and easy to understand.
